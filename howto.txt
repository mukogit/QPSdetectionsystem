Rapport: Fringe Box
Intro: 
Instructions for making the shell for the fringe box as well as the PCB board needed for the project. 
Making: 
1.	Begin with printing the PCB board on to a glossy paper and then cut it out. The Board also needs to be smaller than 40x 65 mm2 (Figure 1).
You find the printable design here: “~D:\Users\co2pc\Box Sync\Glass Processing\Interferometry\Fringe Counter\PCB”
Follow the instructions on the blue cabinet in the lab for making the PCB board.
2.	Print the Following parts:
Box:
1)	Box
2)	Lid
3)	Fiber-clamp 
You find all .stl files here: “~\Box Sync\Glass Processing\Interferometry\Fringe Counter\3D Printer”

3.	Get all parts for the teensy board and solder them according to Figure 1
1)	2x Black Cables (Ca 100mm)
2)	2x Red Cables (Ca 100mm)
3)	BNC plug  
4)	Light to Voltage sensor (TLV257R) / Laser sensor
5)	2x 10k Ω Resistor (The resistance value should be as close as possible to each other)
6)	2x 1k Ω Resistor (The resistance value should be as close as possible to each other)
7)	3x 100nF Capacitor (The capacitance values should be as close to each other as possible)
8)	Teensy board
9)	Pins for teensy 
10)	Teensy DIP
11)	4x Nuts (3M)
12)	4x Bolts (3M)
13)	Optional: Operational amplifier LMC6042 and two short cables (Ca 10mm)
4.	Get the following items:
1)	USB-cable 
2)	2x Glass fiber
3)	2,5 Hex key 
5.	Put the 4 bolts into 2 separate fiber-clamps and then everything is good to go and screw the bolts from the bottom into the nuts. Put the glass fiber inside the fiber-clamp and then everything should be good to go.
6.	You find the teensy and python code to record data here:
“~\Box Sync\Glass Processing\Interferometry\Fringe Counter\Software”
7.	“Install” T40_singlephasecounter onto your teensy. Your Teensy will record the voltage from your two sensors at 4 KHz and send them on the serial port to the computer.
If you want to save the data run the python file “start.py”, connect to your Teensy and click “Continuous reading”. Your data will now be saved.
