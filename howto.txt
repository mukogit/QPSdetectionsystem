PCB board: 
1.	You find the printable pcb layout: “https://github.com/mukogit/QPSdetectionsystem/blob/main/pcb/pcbboard.pdf”
2.	Make the PCB board

Housing:
1. You can 3D-print the following files to be able to mount the pcb board in an opaque housing, and to clamp the waveguides in front of the detectors
	1)	Box
	2)	Lid
	3)	waveguide_clamp
	
You find all .stl files here: “https://github.com/mukogit/QPSdetectionsystem/blob/main/stl-files”

Mounting:
1)  Get all parts listed in: "https://github.com/mukogit/QPSdetectionsystem/blob/main/listofcomponents.txt"
2)	Solder the components to the pcb-board as illustrated in: - "https://github.com/mukogit/QPSdetectionsystem/blob/main/pcb/pcb_description.pdf"
															  - "https://github.com/mukogit/QPSdetectionsystem/blob/main/electricalcuircuit.pdf"
3)	Mount the pcb-board inside the 3D-printed box.															  
4)  Fasten waveguides inside the box to the pcb-board using the waveguide_clamps.

Data recording:
1)	You find the teensy and python code to record data here: "https://github.com/mukogit/\QPSdetectionsystem\software"
2)	The Teensy microcontroller will record the voltage from your two sensors at 5 kHz and send them on the serial port to the computer.
3)  If you run the python file "main.py", you connect to your Teensy (by choosing the right COM port) and the data is saved to the same folder as "main.py".
